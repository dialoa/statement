::: theorem
(Pythagoras) The sum of angles in a triangle is equal to 
two right angles.
:::

::: {.theorem #quadratic}
The solutions of a quadratric equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ 
are given by: 
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
:::

::: remark
A quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$ has two real solutions 
if and only if $b^2 - 4ac > 0$.
:::

::: proof
Obvious from Theorem @quadratic.
